**repocribro** is `Python`_ powered web application allowing users to register their
`GitHub`_ repositories so they can be managed, searched, browsed, tested, etc. (depends
on used extensions) within the app. Main idea is to provide simple but powerful modular
tool for building groups of `GitHub`_ repositories which are developed by different users
and organizations with some common goal.

*Cribro* means sieve in `Italian language`_ (origins in Latin word *cribrum*). This project
provides tool for intelligent sifting repositories, information about them and its contents.

This project has been created as final semester work for subject MI-PYT, CTU in Prague
(more in :doc:`credits`).

Project is open-source (under `MIT license`_) published `@GitHub`_. Basically you just
need to always include the copyright and permission notice with name of author. But it
would be great if you let us know that you are using **repocribro** in any way!!!
